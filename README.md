# About
The purpose of this project was to create a video recognition service that can detect motorcylists that are lane-splitting near your car. Some of the cars today can already detect when there is another car next to you, but detecting a motorcyclist lane-splitting through traffic is still not that easy.

This project uses the ImageAI library available for Python and currently uses the YOLOv3 model. In the future, I would like to train my own model for specifically identifying the front of a motorcycle. I also want to come up with a way to calculate the distance of the motorcycle so that I notify the driver of how far away the vehicle is.
